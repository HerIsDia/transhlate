## What is this thing ?

Transhlate is a fun tool developped by [DiamantDev](https://diamantdev.github.io) to "translate" a text from a lot of different language to transform your text into a completly another text.

In other terms, this tool will put your text in a language A, the result will be in a language B, then the result will be in a language C, and so on, until you get your final text in a language choosen who **absolutely not** (or maybe, if you have some chance) be the same as the original text.

The project is splited into different part:

- The **Discord bot**, a bot on discord to use the tool via commands.
- The **Google sheet**, the origins of the project, a huge google sheet to use the tool via google sheets and official google translate API. (via the GOOGLETRANSLATE formula.)
- [Soon...] The **Website**, a website to use the tool, check documentations, help, and host the API on it.
